[00:02.76] A star never seen
[00:05.16] Shining so bright on your screen
[00:08.15] I don't know what it is like
[00:10.51] To feel alone (To feel alone)
[00:14.73] Loved by the world
[00:17.03] A little more couldn't hurt
[00:19.87] This is what brought me to fame
[00:22.23] Around the globe (Around the globe)
[00:26.12] I can be your star if you want me to (If you want me to)
[00:32.19] Dance along or cry thousand tears for you
[00:38.12] I have been so much of collective fantasies of yours
[00:43.11] Nothing's new to me
[00:44.56] What is left to see that's just for me?
[00:49.35] I am just a little broken, follow my eyes
[00:52.11] You put your fear inside a girl that's broken inside
[00:55.21] Just hope your wish for joy will come out true (Will come out true)
[01:00.99] Pulling paper out my sweets, I'm praying for tips
[01:03.84] But only filled with brittle parts like a bag full of chips
[01:06.71] Who am I to deny where I'm from?
[01:11.18] What I'm from?
[01:24.80] How is it bliss when I see down the abyss?
[01:30.12] So many clouds that obscure what I shall not see (I shall not see)
[01:36.24] So let's sing along, your favorite song, I
[01:39.28] Can't believe it, how fast it's going down
[01:41.96] Every heart and soul is out to know the truth
[01:47.85] Am I just a little broken, falling for lies?
[01:50.56] I hear the fear inside your song my vocals enlive
[01:53.52] So let me sing your chorus out of tune (Out of tune)
[01:59.48] Pulling paper out my sweets, I'm praying for tips
[02:02.25] But only filled with shaky parts like a bag full of fish
[02:05.29] Who am I to deny where I'm from?
[02:09.68] Where I'm from?
[02:12.37] This is a message to all my fans
[02:14.28] Not Teto, but me, the producer
[02:16.09] YES, I EXIST! And honestly
[02:17.85] I've been getting insecure about music and stuff, because
[02:20.48] Why are so many people so fucking talented?
[02:22.96] Like, everybody is so creative and unique, and then there's me
[02:26.48] I just liked "BIRDBRAIN" so much, I decided to copy it, just copy it
[02:30.81] Yeah, I still need to find my own style, I don't know
[02:33.01] I— I don't know
[02:34.80] I am just a little broken, follow my eyes
[02:37.56] You put your fear inside a girl that's broken inside
[02:40.28] Just hope your wish for joy will come out true (Will come out true)
[02:46.40] Pulling paper out my sweets, I'm praying for tips
[02:49.20] But only filled with brittle parts like a bag full of chips
[02:52.04] Who am I to deny where I'm from?
[02:56.44] What I'm from?
[02:58.10] I am just a little broken, follow my eyes (Just a little broken)
[03:01.19] You put your fear inside a girl that's broken inside (Just a little broken)
[03:03.91] Just hope your wish for joy will come out true (Will come out true)
[03:09.75] Pulling paper out my sweets, I'm praying for tips (Just a little broken)
[03:12.50] But only filled with brittle parts like a bag full of chips (I'm just a little broken)
[03:15.51] Who am I to deny where I'm from?
[03:19.90] What I'm from?
